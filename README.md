Vpon's Scala Style Guidelines
=================

This repository contains style guidelines for writing Scala code at Vpon. The guidelines are based on [Paypal's style](https://github.com/paypal/scala-style-guide/). Here are our goals for style
guides in this repository:

1. Our style guidelines should be clear.
2. We all should agree on our style guidelines.
3. We should change this guideline as we learn and as Scala evolves.

# Whitespace

* Use two spaces for indentation.
* Add a newline to the end of every file.

# Line Length

* Use a maximum line length of 140 characters.

# Names

## Functions, Classes and Variables

Use camel case for all function, class and variable names. Classes start with an upper case letter, and values and
functions start with a lower case. Constants use upper case and underscores. Here are some examples:

```scala
class MyClass {
  val myValue = 1
  def myFunction: Int = myValue
}

object MyClass {
  val BEAUTIFUL_CONSTANT = 12
}
```
### Acronyms

Use camel case for acroynms, for example, `HttpUtil`. For consistency, this includes class names like `Ttl` and `Json` as well as common terms such as `Db` and `Io`. Follow normal camel-casing rules.

```scala
val httpIoJsonToXmlParser = new HttpIoJsonToXmlParser()
```

## Package Objects

Package names should be all lowercase with no underscores.

File names for package objects must match the most specific name in the package.
For example, for the `com.vpon.mypackage` package object, the file
should be named `mypackage.scala` and the file should be structured like this:


```scala
package com.vpon

package object mypackage {
  //...
}
```

# Classes

## Public Methods

Limit the number of public methods in your class to 30.

## Default Parameter Values

Eliminate default values in classes and case classes, especially when adding more fields to existing classes. Default values may be used only in justified cases. Does the class appear in too many places and there would be a lot of code to fix? That is **not** justified case.

Prefer

```scala
case class MyClass(count: Int, title: String)

```

over

```scala
case class MyClass(count: Int, title: String = "Unknown")
```

#### How to deal with this rule?

In certain cases it may be convenient to add factory methods on companion objects which would create new instance using default values.

```scala
object MyClass {
  def unknown(count: Int) = MyClass(count, "Unkown")
}
```

Other alternative may be to reflect different possibilities in different types:

```scala
sealed trait MyClass {
  def count: Int
  def title: String
}

case class KnownMyClass(count: Int, title: String) extends MyClass
case class UnknownMyClass(count: Int) extends MyClass {
  val title = "Unknown"
}
```

> **Why?** Default values for class fields may introduce bugs that are hard to track. By eliminating usage of default values when adding more fields to a class, developer is forced to examine its every occurence and fix according to situation.


# Imports

## Ordering

IntelliJ's code style configuration allows for automatic grouping of imports by namespace.
We use the following ordering, which you should add to your IntelliJ configuration
(found in Preferences > Code Style > Scala):

```
java
___blank line___
scala
___blank line___
akka
spray
all other imports
___blank line___
com.vpon
```

You should also regularly run IntelliJ's Optimize Imports (Edit > Optimize Imports) against
your code before merging with `develop`, to maintain import cleanliness.

## Location

Most `import`s in a file should go at the top, right below the package name. The
only time you should break that rule is if you import some or all names from
an `object` from inside a `class`. For example:

```scala
package mypackage

import a.b.c.d
import d.c.b.a

class MyClass {
  import Utils._
  import MyClassCompanion.A
}

object MyClassCompanion {
  case class A()
}

object Utils {
  case class Util1()
  case class Util2()
}
```

## Predef

Never `import` anything inside of Scala's
['Predef'](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.10.3/index.html#scala.Predef$)
object. It is automatically imported for you, so it's redundant to manually
`import`. IntelliJ will often try to import it, so be aware.

# Values

Use `val` by default. `var`s should be limited to local variables or `private` class variables. Their usage
should be well documented, including any considerations that developers must make with respect to concurrency.

One common usage of `var`s will be inside of Akka `Actor`s. Here's an example of that usage:

```scala
class MyActor extends Actor {
  //This is local state to the actor that represents the current sum of all integers it has received.
  //It must be marked private and never accessed outside of the processing of a single message, to ensure
  //that it's concurrency safe. Additionally, don't acquire a lock before you access this variable.
  //Doing so might block message processing unnecessarily. If you follow all of these rules related to concurrency,
  //you shouldn't need a lock anyway.
  private var sum: Int = 0

  override def receive: Receive {
    case i: Int => sum = sum + 1
  }
}
```

## Modifiers

Optional variable modifiers should be declared in the following order: `override access (private|protected) final implicit lazy`.

For example,

```scala
private implicit lazy val someSetting = ...
```

Use `private[this]` modifier (instance-scope hiding) instead of `private` (unless required by use case).

> **Why?** Scala compiler can optimize `private[this]` modifiers.

# Functions

Rules to follow for all functions:

* Always put a space after `:` characters in function signatures.
* Always put a space after `,` in function signatures.
* Make sure a function does not exceed 80 lines (one screen).
* Using `return` is strongly discouraged (a. k. a. _Use with extreme caution and only in justified cases_).
* If function is meant to be used outside, always explicitly declare return type.

## Public Functions
All public functions and methods, including those inside `object`s must have:

* A return type
* Scaladoc including a function overview, information on parameters, and information on the return value. See the [Scaladoc](#scaladoc-comments-and-annotations) section for more details.

Here is a complete example of a function inside of an `object`.

```scala
object MyObject {
  /**
   * returns the static integer 123
   * @return the number 123
   */
  def myFunction: Int = {
    123
  }
}
```

### Partial Functions

One-line partial functions are allowed but only when the whole expression is very short, typically inside `filter` or `map` functions.

```scala
List((1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')).map { case (x, _) => x * 2 }
```

### Nested Functions

Do not use more than two levels of nested functions.

```scala
class OurClass {
  
  // Do
  def fun1 = {
    def fun2 = ???
    ???
  }

  // Don't
  def fun1 = {
    def fun2 = {
      def fun3 = ???
      ???
    }
    ???
  }

}
```

### Parameter Lists

If a function has a parameter list with fewer than 70 characters, put all parameters on the same line:

```scala
def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
  ...
}
```

If a function has long or complex parameter lists, follow these rules:

1. Put the first parameter on the same line as the function name.
2. Put the rest of the parameters each on a new line, aligned with the first parameter.
3. If the function has multiple parameter lists, align the opening parenthesis with the previous one and align
parameters the same as #2.

Example:

```scala
def lotsOfParams(aReallyLongParameterNameOne: Int,
                 aReallyLongParameterNameTwo: Int,
                 aReallyLongParameterNameThree: Int,
                 aReallyLongParameterNameFour: Int)
                (implicit adder: Adder,
                 reader: Reader): Int = {
  ...
}
```

For function names over 30 characters, try to shorten the name. If you can't,
start the parameter list on the next line and indent everything 2 spaces:

```scala
def aVeryLongMethodThatShouldHaveAShorterNameIfPossible(
  aParam: Int,
  anotherParam: Int,
  aThirdParam: Int)
 (implicit iParam: Foo,
  bar: Bar): String = {
  ...
}
```

In all cases, the function's return type still has to be written directly
following the last closing parenthesis.

#### Calling Functions

When calling functions with numerous arguments, place the first parameter on the
same line as the function and align the remaining parameters with the first:

```scala
fooBar(someVeryLongFieldName,
       andAnotherVeryLongFieldName,
       "this is a string",
       3.1415)
```

For functions with very long names, start the parameter list on the second line
and indent by 2 spaces:

```scala
aMuchLongerMethodNameThatShouldProbablyBeRefactored(
  aParam,
  anotherParam,
  aThirdParam)
```

It's your choice whether to place closing parenthesis directly following the
last parameter or on a new line (in "dangling" style).

You can do this:

```scala
aLongMethodNameThatReturnsAFuture(
  aParam,
  anotherParam,
  aThirdParam
).map { res =>
  ...
}
```

Or this:

```scala
aLongMethodNameThatReturnsAFuture(
  aParam,
  anotherParam,
  aThirdParam).map { res =>
  ...
}
```

## Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions start on the same line as preceding code. Declarations
start with ` { ` (note the space before and after the `{`). Arguments are then
listed on the same line. A few more notes:

* Do not use braces after the argument list, just start the function body on the next line.
* Argument types are not necessary. You should use them if it makes the code clearer though.

Here's a complete example example:

```scala
Option(123).map { number =>
  println(s"the number plus one is: ${number + 1}")
}
```

### Exceptions to the Rule

Use parentheses and an underscore for anonymous functions that are:

* single binary operations
* a single method invocation on the input
* two or fewer unary methods on the input

Examples:

```scala
val list = List("list", "of", "strings")
list.filter(_.length > 2)
list.filter(_.contains("i"))
```

## Passing named functions

If the function takes a single argument, then arguments and underscores should be omitted.

For example:
```scala
Option(123).map(println)
```

is preferred over

```scala
Option(123).map(println(_))
```

## Calling functions

Prefer dot notation except for these specific scenarios:
1. Specs2 matchers
2. Akka ```pipeTo```, ```!```, ```?```

For example:
```scala
Option(someInt).map(println)
```

is preferred over

```scala
Option(someInt) map println
```

##### Rule Exceptions

Java <=> Scala interoperation on primitives: Scala and Java booleans, for example, are not directly compatible, and
require an implicit conversion between one another. Normally this is handled automagically by the Scala compiler, but
the following code would reveal a compiler error:

```scala
Option(true).foreach(someMethodThatTakesAJavaBoolean)
```

A named parameter is *not* necessary to achieve this. An underscore should be used to resolve the implicit conversion.
To avoid confusion, please also add a note that a Scala <=> Java conversion is taking place:

```scala
Option(true).foreach(someMethodThatTakesAJavaBoolean(_))  // lol java
```

# Logic Flows

In general, logic that handles a choice between two or more outcomes should prefer to use `match`.

## If, Then, Else

One-line if–else statements are allowed if the whole expression is very short and comprehensible.

```scala
val b: Int = if(click) then 1 else 0
```

In case of multi-line if–else statement, always use curly braces and put `} else {` on one line:

Do

```scala
val b: Option[String] = if(stmt.isEmpty) {
  None
} else {
  // do something
  // with stmt
  // on more lines
}
```

Don't:

```scala
val b: Option[String] = if(stmt.isEmpty)
  None
else {
  // do something
  // with stmt
  // on more lines
}
```

## Match Statements

When you `match` on any type, follow these rules:

1. Pattern matching should be exhaustive and explicitly handle the failure/default case rather than relying on a runtime `MatchError`. (This is specific to match blocks and not case statements in partial functions.) Case classes used in pattern matching should extend a common `sealed trait` so that compiler warnings will be generated for inexhaustive matching.
2. Indent all `case` statements at the same level, and put the `=>` one space to
  the right of the closing `)`
3. Short single line expressions should be on the same line as the `case`
4. Long single line and multi-line expressions should be on the line below the case, indented one level from the `case`.
5. Filters on case statements should be on the same line if doing so will not make the line excessively long.

Here's a complete example:

```scala
Option(123) match {
  case Some(i: Int) if i > 0 =>
    val intermediate = doWorkOn(i + 1)
    doMoreWorkOn(intermediate)
  case _ => 123
}
```

## Exceptions

### Catching Exceptions

In try-catch block, do not catch `Throwable`, use `NonFatal(ex)` instead.

Do

```scala
try {
  somethingDangerous()
} catch {
  case NonFatal(ex)=> // handle ex
}
```

Don't:

```scala
try {
  somethingDangerous()
} catch {
  case ex: Throwable => // handle ex
}
```

> **Why?** There are multiple exceptions that extend `Throwable` but in general should not be caught, for example `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError`. Also there exists a set of exceptions that extend `ControlThrowable` and are used for flow control (e. g. `break()`), catching these would cause hard-to-debug errors.

### Custom Exceptions

1. Prefer non-case classes when defining exceptions and errors unless you plan on pattern matching on the exception.
2. If providing a cause is desirable and not mandatory then define it as an option. Note, the use of ```.orNull```.

```scala
class CrazyException(msg: String, cause: Option[Throwable]) extends Exception(msg, cause.orNull)
class SuperCrazyError(msg: String, cause: Option[Throwable]) extends Error(msg, cause.orNull)
```

## Option

Flows with `Option` values should be constructed using the `match` keyword as follows.

```scala
def stuff(i: Int): Int = { ... }

Option(123) match {
  case None => 0
  case Some(number) => stuff(number)
}
```

The `.fold` operator should generally not be used. Simple, single-line patterns are acceptable for `.fold`, such as:

```scala
def stuff(i: Int): Int = { ... }

Option(123).fold(0)(stuff)
```

Similarly, simple patterns are acceptable for `.map` with `.getOrElse`, such as:

```scala
def stuff(i: Int): Int = { ... }

Option(123).map(stuff).getOrElse(0)
```

You should enforce expected type signatures, as `match` does not guarantee consistent types between match outcomes
(e.g. the `None` case could return `Int`, while the `Some` case could return `String`).


## For Comprehension

### When To Use for Comprehension?

#### Futures

If `map`/`flatMap` is used only once, it is not necessary to use for comprehension. However, in case of composing more 
futures, use for comprehension.

Do

```scala
val f2 = f1.map(f => calculate(f))

val f3 = for {
  a <- f1
  b <- f2
  c = op1(a, b)
  d = op2(a, c)
} yield op3(c, d)
```

Don't

```scala
val f3 = f1.flatMap { a =>
  f2.map { b => 
    val c = op1(a, b)
    val d = op2(a, c)
    op3(c, d)
  }
}
```

### Styling

For comprehensions should generally not be wrapped in parentheses in order to recover, flatMap, etc.
Instead, separate the for comprehension into its own variable and perform additional operations on that.

```scala
val userAddress = for {
  address <- loadAddress()
} yield address

userAddress.recover {
  // recover from loadAddress exception
}.flatMap {
  // pull info from address, etc.
}
```

In addition, if performing additional operations on the result of the yield as part of the result of the for comprehension itself,
code should be separated by braces and begin on a newline. For example:

```scala
for {
  address <- loadAddress() // returns Option
} yield {
  address match {
    case Some(s) => ...
    case None => ...
  }
}
```

# Other Scala Features

## String Interpolation

Never use string interpolation in logging.

Do

```scala
log.error("An exception was thrown for value {}: {}", value, ex)
log.error(String.format("An exception was thrown for value %.12f: %s"), value, ex)
```

Don't

```scala
log.error(s"An exception was thrown for value $value: $ex")
log.error(f"An exception was thrown for value $value%.12f: $ex")
```

## Functors

Do not nest `map` more than twice. Use named values/functions instead.

## Handling Date And Time

It is strongly recommended to use time library (either `java.time` or Joda Time) instead of doing calculations with milliseconds. As one implication of this rule, using `System.currentTimeMillis()` is strongly discouraged and should not be used for time operations. This does not apply to storing date/time in DB where unix time is acceptable.
 
Do

```scala
val baseDate = LocalDateTime.now()
val twoWeeksLater = baseDate.plusWeeks(2)
```

Don't

```scala
val now = System.currentTimeMillis()
val twoWeeks = 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
val twoWeeksLater = now + twoWeeks
```

> **Why?** Date/time arithmetic is extremely complicated domain and it is impossible to make it right on one's own. Not every year has 365 days, not every day has 4×60×60 seconds, time zones change a few times a year, daylight-saving time rules change all the time etc.

# Akka

## Ask and Tell

Prefer ```!``` and ```?``` over ```.tell``` and ```.ask```.

```scala
someActor1 ! msg
someActor2 ? msg
```

is preferred over

```scala
someActor1.tell(msg)
someActor2.ask(msg)
```

## Actors

**Good practice**: It is desirable within an actor implementation to use properly named pure functions that only return required result in form of value. If the result is required to be sent to other actor (e. g. sender), it should be done outside this function.

This point is marked as _good practice_ because there may be cases when doing opposite is justifiable.

```scala
class MyActor extends Actor {
  def receive = {
     case "statistics" => sender() ! statistics   // ← we immediately know what is happening
  }

  def statistics = {
    val result = ??? // do some calculation
    result
  }
}
```

is preferred over

```scala
class MyActor extends Actor {
  def receive = {
     case "statistics" => reportStatistics()   // ← we need to check the function to see what is happening
  }

  def reportStatistics() = {
    val result = ??? // do some calculation
    sender() ! result
  }
}
```

> **Why?** `receive` method is an entry point for readers of actor code and gives thorough picture about actor's behavior. Therefore it should be easy to understand actor's behavior only by looking at the `receive` method. Following this good practice there is a clear separation of responsibilities between calculating results (pure function) and effects (sending result). It also helps testability.

## Naming Conventions

In Akka configuration, use lower-case names with words devided by hyphen.

Do

```
number-of-something = 5
```

Don't

```
number_of_something = 5
numberOfSomethingElse = 6
```

# Tests

TBD

# Scaladoc, Comments, and Annotations

All classes, objects, traits, and methods should be documented. Generally, follow the documentation guidelines
provided by the Scala Documentation Style Guide on [ScalaDoc](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html).

Rules:

* Classes that are instantiated via methods in a companion object **must** include ScalaDoc documentation with a code example.
* Abstract classes *should* be documented with an example of their intended implementation.
* Implicit wrapper classes **must** include ScalaDoc documentation with a code example.
* Public, protected, and package-private methods **must** include ScalaDoc documentation.
* Private methods *should* be documented, however it is left to the discretion of the developer as to the level of documentation.
* All methods **must** include `@throws` annotations if they throw an exception in their normal operation.

Use your best judgment otherwise, and err toward more documentation rather than less.

# Further Reading

Several of these recommendations are adapted from the Scala Documentation Style Guide,
including [Declarations](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/declarations.html) and
[Indentation](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/indentation.html). The guidelines presented
in this document should supersede all other style recommendations.
